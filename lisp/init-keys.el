;;; init-keys.el --- Key bindings

;;; Commentary:

;;; Code:


;; On Mac OS, use Cmd as Meta key, make Right Opt into an extra Ctrl,
;; and pass left Opt on unchanged to Mac OS for alternative characters
(setopt mac-command-modifier 'meta)
(setopt mac-option-modifier 'none)
(setopt mac-right-option-modifier 'ctrl)

;; Enable the built-in Windmove (Shift + arrow keys to move between windows)
(windmove-default-keybindings)

;; Winner mode - use C-c Left/Right to undo/redo the window configuration
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'winner-mode)

;; Repeat mode - allow pressing just the last key to repeat some combos
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'repeat-mode)


;; Set up the keyboard so the delete key on both the regular keyboard
;; and the keypad delete the character under the cursor and to the right
;; under X, instead of the default, backspace behavior.
(global-set-key [delete] 'delete-char)
(global-set-key [kp-delete] 'delete-char)

;; Some necessary Keyboard remappings for sanity
(global-unset-key "\C-z")  ; Don't let C-z iconify the frame
(global-unset-key "\C-l")  ; Disable recentering to avoid a nervous tic
;(global-set-key (kbd "C-.") 'set-mark-command)    ; alternative to C-SPC
;(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-.") 'pop-global-mark) ; alternative to C-x SPC
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c SPC") 'just-one-space)  ; since M-SPC may be in use by the OS
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x k") 'kill-current-buffer)  ; don't pop up a buffer list
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x K") 'kill-buffer)  ; use with Shift-K to get the list


;; Make SE keyboard use same physical keys as US layout for some things
;; (only use M-- for negative-argument, since we remap C-- to undo)
;; this makes US key /? work as the main undo key also in SE keymap (labeled -_)
(global-set-key (kbd "C--") 'undo)       ; (C-- defaults to negative-argument)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-_") 'undo-redo)  ; (C-_ defaults to undo)

(global-set-key (kbd "M-+") 'negative-argument)
;; this makes keys labeled + or - work for text scale in both SE and US
;; (increase/decrease text scale get reversed in SE layout, but that's ok;
;; also note that since ´` is a dead key pressing C-´ yields just ´)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x ´") (function (lambda () (interactive) (text-scale-adjust -1))))
; this makes US key 6^ work as join-line and enlarge-window also in SE keymap (labeled 6&)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-&") 'delete-indentation)  ; (M-& defaults to async-shell-command)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x &") 'enlarge-window)
; this makes US key \| work as normal also in SE keymap (labeled '*)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-M-'") 'indent-region)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-*") 'shell-command-on-region)

;; Move some US-centric bindings to match SE keyboard legends, mainly + and -
;; (in particular, US =+ and ]} are dead keys ´` and ^¨ in SE, so avoid them)

(global-set-key (kbd "M-z") 'undo)

;; Make delete-horizontal-space cycle through spacings instead, and allow

(global-set-key [remap delete-horizontal-space] 'cycle-spacing)
